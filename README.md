### FULL STACK DEVELOPER


### Guten Tag! I am Urs 🌋

### About me 🐡 🐡 🐡

I am a Social Psychologist who turned Artist aiming to end up as a developer in tech. I am interested in hermaphroditic organisms and get a laugh out of dark book titles like “The trouble with being born”. Furthermore, I have an indestructible sense of optimism and am a proud father of a one-and-a-half-year-old girl. I came to coding because I love working in teams to collaborate on something that has a much larger impact. I just graduated from the Codaisseur Full-Stack Developer bootcamp which greatly expanded my practical skillset.

### 🛠 Projects 🛠

### 🤣 🌈 💩 Cards Against Humanity Against Yourself [🔗](https://github.com/ursmoore/C_A_H_frontend) 

Cards Against Humanity Against Yourself is a single-player version of the cult card game for horrible people that I programmed during a 7 day portfolio challenge. I thought it would be fun to create a horrible joke generator. For that I created a gameplay environment where you can pair and submit card combinations which are stored in a database and can be inspected by every user in the best combinations section. Furthermore I programmed a create-a-card-function for black and white cards, so if you have a horrible idea, you can save it for the world in my RestAPI till eternity. The front-end was developed with React. I used Redux for global state management and for the backend I used Node.js, Sequelize and ElephantSQL.



### 😏 🤣 😱 We Went Through Hell So you Don't Have To [🔗](https://github.com/ursmoore/WWTHSOYDHT_Frontend)

As part of the Codaisseur bootcamp, we had to develop a project in a group using the React framework in approximately four days. My teammate was Emre Tuğutlu and Benjamin Ghassemi and we decided to create a where-not-to-go-to travelblog. The aim of this project was to show that we could use React in other contexts as well. I had a lot of fun working in a team and communicating/discussing implementation solutions.
